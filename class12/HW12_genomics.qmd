Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their
corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
file <- "https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213_W19/class-material/rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt"
data <- read.table(file)
head(data)
```

```{r}
table(data$geno)
```

```{r}
median(data$exp[data$geno=='A/A'])
median(data$exp[data$geno=='A/G'])
median(data$exp[data$geno=='G/G'])
```


Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative
expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the
expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(geno, exp, col = geno)) +
  geom_boxplot( )
```

Having a G/G SNP in this location is associated with a reduced expression of ORMDL3. Having an A/A or A/G in this location will result in higher expression of ORMDL3.
